# CashuCardWallet
*"Writing a description for this thing for general audiences is bloody hard. There's nothing to relate it to."*
--Satoshi Nakamoto, July 5, 2010

The goal is to vibe code a NIP 60 cashu wallet using MKStacks on Shakeshpeare.diy.

This is an experiment in using AI to create a NIP 60 Cashu wallet using Standard American English as a computer language. The goal is to create [realia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/realia) designed to teach children how to use bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.


Here is my English Code.

```
Create a nostr client named Cashu Cards. The client shopuld allow a user to create a nostr key using NIP 06. Once the user creates a nostr keypair, the user should be instructed to backup the identity by writing down 12 seed words.

This client also creates a NIP 60 cashu wallet for the user and the ability to chose a reputible mint using NIP 87. All Nip 57 zaps should be redirected to the user's cashu wallet. The user should also be able to send cashu to any other cashu wallet.

The site should warn that this is for educational purposes only and not cybersecurity or investment advice. The user should not use make cashu than they are willing to lose.


The theme should be bitcoin orange and white.

It should be mobile responsive and UX friendly using Tailwind's mobile-first classes.

###
Here is the result:
